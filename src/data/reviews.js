Number of rotten stringers that needed total replacement. His attitude was positive throughout the project and he would leave the space as neat as possible at the end of every work day.

    text: "I made the right decision by hiring ML. The owner and the guy that works with him, were very professional and friendly. They took their time and worked on my 20 year old deck and restored it nicely....saving me thousands of dollars by not having to put a new deck in. They also removed a ton of old moldy sheetrock and fixed my eve on my front porch. After all the work was done, they removed everything from the property. ML, work was very good and I am extremely pleased with the price, too.",

They are hard working, dependable, honest, reliable, reasonable, considerate, and sticklers for perfection. If you need any construction work done, do not hesitate to call them.
